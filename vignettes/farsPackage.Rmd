FarsPackage helps in reading Fatality Analysis Reporting System(FARS) data file and perform some analysis on it. 
You can easily include this package using following command:
```{r}
library(farsPackage)
```

Once package is loaded, you can use following functions to summarize and visualize FARS data.

## Loading data

To load data, you need to copy valid FARS file name into the working directory.

The function `system.file` is the key that will allow us to gain access to the 2013 to 2015 data within the package.

```{r accessfarsdat}
### the following code reads access the accident_2013.csv.bz2 file in the folder extdata in package farsPackage and save it as an R object named fars_2013
fars_2013 <- system.file("extdata", "accident_2013.csv.bz2", package = "farsPackage")
fars_2014 <- system.file("extdata", "accident_2014.csv.bz2", package = "farsPackage")
fars_2015 <- system.file("extdata", "accident_2015.csv.bz2", package = "farsPackage")

### copy the file from its folder and save it to the working directory
file.copy(from = fars_2013, to = getwd()) 
file.copy(from = fars_2014, to = getwd()) 
file.copy(from = fars_2015, to = getwd()) 
```

You can place any valid FARS file data with the provided file name format inside working directory. Then, you can use library functions without any error.

## Summarizing years of data

You can use following R command to summarize any FARS file data

```{r}
summarized_data <- fars_summarize_years(c(2013,2014,2015))
head(summarized_data)
```
This data represents the number of fatalities occurring in different months of provided years.

## Visualizing Summarized Data

To Visualize fatalities data on the basis of different states, you can use following R command:

```{r}
fars_map_state(state.num = 4, year=2013)
fars_map_state(state.num = 4, year=2014)
fars_map_state(state.num = 4, year=2015)
```

## Deleting data from working directory

After you have analyzed FARS data, you can delete files from working directory using following R commands.

```{r deldat}
file.remove("./accident_2013.csv.bz2")
file.remove("./accident_2014.csv.bz2")
file.remove("./accident_2015.csv.bz2")
```
